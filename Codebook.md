This file explains all the variables that forms the output from the script.

dataset1.txt contains all these values as asked in step 4 of project description.
dataset2.txt on the other hand contains their average value grouped by the subject and the activity. Though the dataset shows variable name as below but it should not be confused as the actual data as described below as it is the mean based on grouping according to subject and activity.
